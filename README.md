LUNG SEGMENTATION


Lung segmentation is the image segmentation technique in computer vision which applies deep neural network method. From the chest X-ray, it is possible to segment the lung from the original images for medical analysis purposes.


TEFPA framework:

    -TASK: segmenting lung's position from an X-ray image.
    
    -EXPERIENCE: X-ray images and corresponding lung's masks images dataset.
    
    -FUNCTION SPACE: model U-net. 
    
    -PERFORMANCE MEASURE: Intersection over Union (IoU) metric.
    
    -ALGORITHM: optimizer Adam.
